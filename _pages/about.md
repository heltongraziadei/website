Hi! I’m an Assistant Professor of Statistics at the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar), Brazil. My research interests lie at the intersection of statistical modeling, machine learning, and uncertainty quantification. I teach statistical methods and work on applied research projects, often in time series, biostatistics, and actuarial science. 

## Education
- Postdoctoral fellowship, School of Applied Mathematics, Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV). 
- PhD in Statistics, University of São Paulo (USP), with a one-year visiting period at Bocconi University.
- MSc in Statistics, University of São Paulo (USP)
- BSc in Statistics, University of São Paulo (USP)

## Research interests
- Time series forecasting (including integer-valued forecasting)
- Uncertainty quantification and conformal prediction
- Actuarial / insurance applications: mortality & longevity, frequency–severity modeling, and agricultural risk

If you’re a student interested in research (or a collaborator), feel free to reach out ([helton@ufscar.br](mailto:helton@ufscar.br)).
