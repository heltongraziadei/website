Hi! I’m **Helton Graziadei**, an **Assistant Professor of Statistics** at the **Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar), Brazil**.  
I work at the intersection of **statistical modeling, uncertainty quantification, and machine learning**, with a particular taste for problems where decisions matter (and data behave badly).

## What I do
I develop and teach modern statistical methods, and I build applied research projects—often in **insurance/actuarial science**, **risk modeling**, and **forecasting**.

- **Teaching:** probability, statistical inference, regression/GLMs, machine learning, time series, and applied data science  
- **Research:** methods for reliable prediction (especially prediction intervals) and model assessment under realistic assumptions  
- **Applied work:** risk and loss modeling, including actuarial and climate-related contexts

## Education
- **PhD in Statistics**, **University of São Paulo (USP)**  
- **MSc in Statistics**, **University of São Paulo (USP)**

## Research interests
- **Uncertainty quantification** and **prediction intervals**
- **Conformal prediction** (and extensions for time-dependent / non-exchangeable data)
- **Statistical learning**: model evaluation, robustness, and interpretability
- **Time series forecasting** (including probabilistic forecasting)
- **Actuarial / insurance applications**: mortality & longevity, frequency–severity modeling, and agricultural risk
