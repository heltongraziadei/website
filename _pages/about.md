Hi! I’m an Assistant Professor of Statistics at the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar), Brazil. My research interests lie at the intersection of statistical modeling, machine learning, and uncertainty quantification. I teach modern statistical methods and work on applied research projects—often in time series, actuarial science, and risk modeling.

## Education
- **PhD in Statistics**, **University of São Paulo (USP)**, including a one-year visiting period at Bocconi University.
- **MSc in Statistics**, **University of São Paulo (USP)**
- **BSc in Statistics**, **University of São Paulo (USP)**

## Research interests
- Time series forecasting (including integer-valued forecasting)
- Uncertainty quantification and conformal prediction
- Actuarial / insurance applications: mortality & longevity, frequency–severity modeling, and agricultural risk

If you’re a student interested in research (or a collaborator), feel free to reach out.
