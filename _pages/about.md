Hi! I’m an Assistant Professor of Statistics at the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar), Brazil. My research interests lies at the intersection of statistical modeling, machine learning, and uncertainty quantification. I develop and teach modern statistical methods, and I build applied research projects—often in time series, actuarial science, and risk modeling. 

- Teaching: probability, statistical inference, regression/GLMs, machine learning, time series, and applied data science  
- Research: methods for reliable prediction (especially prediction intervals) and model assessment under realistic assumptions  
- Applied work: risk and loss modeling, including actuarial and climate-related contexts

## Education
- PhD in Statistics**, **University of São Paulo (USP) with a one-year period as a visiting student at Bocconi University. 
- MSc in Statistics**, **University of São Paulo (USP)
- BSc in Statistics**, University of São Paulo (USP)

## Research interests
- Time series forecasting (including integer-valued forecasting)
- Uncertainty quantification and conformal prediction
- Actuarial / insurance applications: mortality & longevity, frequency–severity modeling, and agricultural risk
